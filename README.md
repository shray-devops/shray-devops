## 🚀 About Me

I started my career in the world of databases—designing, tuning, securing, and keeping them alive at all costs. Over the years, I evolved from a traditional **DBA** into a **Database Engineer**, focusing on performance, automation, reliability, and scalable data architectures.

Now, I’m expanding my technical horizon into **Public Cloud** and **DevOps/SRE**. I’m particularly interested in combining strong data fundamentals with cloud-native principles to build modern, resilient systems.

I love solving problems, simplifying complexity, and constantly learning new technologies that make systems fast, reliable, and maintainable.

## Tech Stack & Interests

### **Databases**

* PostgreSQL (primary focus)
* MySQL
* Query optimization, indexing strategy
* Backup/restore automation
* High availability (replication, failover)
* Performance tuning & monitoring

### **Cloud & DevOps (Learning & Building)**

* **AWS** (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch)
* **Linux Administration**
* **CI/CD Pipelines**
* **Containers & Orchestration** – Docker, Kubernetes
* **Infrastructure as Code** – Terraform
* **Monitoring & Alerting**
* **Shell/Bash scripting**

## What I’m Working On Right Now

* Shifting from DB engineering to a **Cloud + DevOps** role
* Building end-to-end cloud-native projects involving databases
* Creating automation scripts for DB operations
* Strengthening my knowledge of Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD workflows
* Preparing for advanced cloud certifications & SRE practices

---

## What I Believe In

* **Systems should heal themselves**
* **Scripts > manual steps**
* **Clarity > cleverness**
* **Learning never stops**
* **Good data makes everything better**

---

## Current Projects

* End-to-end PostgreSQL deployment automation using Terraform + AWS
* Containerizing DB workloads for local and staging environments
* Scripts to automate routine DB maintenance tasks
* Observability + Monitoring for databases and cloud workloads
(Will keep adding more as I build and learn!)
